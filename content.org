I'm Ad! Welcome to my humble corner of the Internet 🙂. I'm a programmer, FOSS proponent, Emacs enthusiast, and digital sovereignty advocate.

I envision a future where everyone, regardless of technical capability, has the ability to take advantage of FOSS. And I want to help us get there 🔧.

** About Me
I've been programming since around 2017, when I decided that I wanted to learn how to mod /Minecraft/ 🤔. I've always taught myself things, so, having no idea how to program (nor how to use the Internet, apparently), I went to the library and borrowed a book on modding /Minecraft/ 📖. Unsurprisingly, with no background, I did not get much done beyond copying and tweaking examples. However, I did take away a curiosity and interest in programming, which would drive the next years of my life ⌨️.

I was lucky enough to stumble upon a book on /Minecraft/ plugin development that did *not* assume the reader had prior knowledge, which is where I learned the fundamentals of programming 😊. After fumbling around with Java for several months, writing several toy programs, and /finally/ understanding how OOP worked, I was more curious than ever, and eager to explore what the programming world had to offer.

Out of nowhere, I decided to learn JavaScript, and quickly learned that it was *not* like Java 😂. I realized that making web pages was a hell of a lot more fun than writing Java programs, so I continued learning JavaScript, and making silly, pointless web pages while abusing frameworks like Vue.js. However, This was also my first true introduction to sharing my creations with others, since, unlike with Java, sharing a program in JavaScript was as simple as sending a link to someone ✉️. I explored further down some tangential branches as well, including dabbling in PHP and MySQL for a few months and experimenting with Laravel; fortunately, that was a short-lived adventure.

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit 💉, and I had plenty of lockdown time to kill, I decided to satiate my curiosity another level. I had heard about Linux, and decided to finally give it a shot, replacing my Windows 10 installation with Pop!_OS 🐧. It would take another year and many re-installs before I finally felt comfortable, but it advanced me from mere programming into a much larger sphere, encompassing additional fields such as system administration and server management, but, most importantly, it introduced me to the FOSS world 🌎.
