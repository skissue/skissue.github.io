I'm Ad! Welcome to my humble corner of the Internet 🙂. I'm a programmer, FOSS proponent, Emacs enthusiast, and digital sovereignty advocate.

** About Me
I've been programming since around 2017, when I decided that I wanted to learn how to mod /Minecraft/ 🤔. Having no idea how to program, nor how to use the Internet, I went to the library and borrowed a book on modding /Minecraft/ 📖. Unsurprisingly, with no background, I did not get much beyond copying and tweaking examples. However, I did take away a curiosity and interest in programming, which would drive the next years of my life ⌨️.

I was lucky enough to stumble upon a book on /Minecraft/ plugin development that did *not* assume the reader had prior knowledge, which is where I learned the fundamentals of programming 😊. After fumbling around with Java for several months, writing several toy programs, and /finally/ understanding how OOP worked, I was more curious than ever.

Out of nowhere, I decided to learn JavaScript, and quickly learned that it was *not* like Java 😂. I realized that making web pages was a hell of a lot more fun than writing Java programs, so I continued learning JavaScript, and making silly, pointless web pages while abusing frameworks like Vue.js. However, This was also my first true introduction to sharing my creations with others, since, unlike with Java, sharing a program in JavaScript was as simple as sending a link to someone.
